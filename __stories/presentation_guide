- Ask everyone individually, Do you test your code?
- Show internet memes of untested code
- Show internet horror stories of untested code
- Find short video (optionally make one)
- Non linear presentation (from back to front to center)
- Poll the audience
- Share the stage with listeners
- Make sure to use short sentences per slide. it is better to 
have plentier slides with less words per slide (human psyche)



- We all never want to be this guy because everyone pretty much
hates this guy <ref: writes_unmaintanable_code> 
...and to avoid that, the necessary things must be done

- It's already hard enough as it is to document your code, but then at the same
time we also get unfairly introduced to the world of tests
<ref: our_initial_confusion>


So being the normal rational human beings we are, we avoid writing tests for as
long as possible
What if rather than bulldozing through a feature, we actually plan that feature,
by writing tests that break the feature even before it exists, then create the
feature to pass that same test. In other words, we need to obey the testing goat
